Vijay Takbhate is a Data Science and MLOps enthusiast skilled in Python, SQL, MLflow, Docker, and CI/CD.
He has worked on multiple end-to-end machine learning projects, focusing on model deployment and automation.

Projects include:
1. Medical Insurance Cost Prediction (SVR): Built a predictive system to estimate medical insurance charges
   using demographic and lifestyle factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. Improved R¬≤ from 0.72 to 0.86
   and reduced MAE from 0.099 to 0.034. Developed a Flask web application, containerized with Docker, and deployed on AWS EC2.
   Implemented MLOps best practices like MLflow tracking, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and Kubeflow pipelines.
   Repository: https://github.com/vijaytakbhate2002/medical-insurance-cost-prediction-SVR.git

2. Turbofan Jet Engine Lifecycle Prediction (CNN + LSTM): Developed a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction
   system using NASA CMAPSS dataset. Built a hybrid CNN + LSTM model for temporal and spatial patterns.
   Implemented an MLOps pipeline with data processing, training, and deployment using AWS and Docker.
